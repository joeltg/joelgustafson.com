# About

I grew up in Duluth MN, graduated from MIT in 2018, and now live in Brooklyn.

I'm broadly interested in

- text editors
- "tools for thought"
- web programming
- category theory
- decentralization
- offline-first apps and peer-to-peer collaboration
- what it's like to be online right now
- ontology, representation, identity, agency, belief, meaning
- Hannah Arendt, Marshall McLuhan, Simone Weil, Ivan Illich
- the pro tennis tour

In 2018 I joined [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) as an independent research scientist, working with the [Knowledge Futures Group](https://knowledgefutures.org/) on [the Underlay](https://underlay.org/).

In summer 2017 I interned at [Notion](https://notion.so/) in the run-up to the Notion 2.0 launch that introduced tables and databases. I designed and implemented the DSL, runtime, editor, and documentation for formulas.

Throughout undergrad I worked with Gerry Sussman on various Scheme projects, like a [native Jupyter kernel for MIT Scheme](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel) and some experimental notebook programming interfaces.

I also worked as an undergradudate researcher in the [Viral Communications Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/viral-communications/overview/) at the Media Lab on an early version of [PubPub](https://pubpub.org/), an open access publishing platform.
