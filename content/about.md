## Work

I'm currently building [Canvas](https://canvas.xyz), a framework for building peer-to-peer applications using decentralized replicated causal logs.

From 2018-2022 I was with [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) as an independent research scientist, collaborating with the [Knowledge Futures Group](https://knowledgefutures.org/) on knowledge graph and semantic web research.

In summer 2017 I interned at [Notion](https://notion.so/) in the run-up to the Notion 2.0 launch that introduced tables and databases. I designed and implemented the DSL, runtime, editor, and documentation for formulas.

Throughout undergrad I worked with Gerry Sussman on various Scheme projects, like a [native Jupyter kernel for MIT Scheme](https://github.com/joeltg/mit-scheme-kernel) and some experimental notebook programming interfaces.

I also worked as an undergradudate researcher in the [Viral Communications Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/viral-communications/overview/) at the Media Lab on an early version of [PubPub](https://pubpub.org/), an open access publishing platform.
