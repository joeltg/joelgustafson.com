# A geometric world now

_2018-07-31_

It's a geometric world now: the walls they all agree

Structure and enclosure and a prim tranquility

But you and I can move through space, and walk across their floors

Nothing can contain our power to permeate their doors

It's a kinesthetic world now: writhing braids of flesh and bone

Trapped inside these bodies we reluctantly call home

But you and I know how to dance; we can actuate our limbs

to signal cross the cosmic haze and articulate our whims

It's a gilded neon world now: bits of ancient arcade chrome

A glowing insect contact in the technicolor zone

And you and I are holding hands as the frame begins to splinter

Our yawning silhouettes awash in sharp chromatic timbre
